# Article-Scraper

The idea for this script is to be able to run it on various web sites that I frequent and return the headlines, summaries, 
and links to articles that are about Python.

To-Do
------
* Need to work out a better way to display the scraped data. Currently you need to open up an ugly Excel doc.
* Want to implement more than just one site to scrape.
