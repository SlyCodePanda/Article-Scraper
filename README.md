# Article-Scraper

Currently just working for the site Geeks for Geeks, but the idea is to scrape sites I frequent for Python specific articles and return them in it's own html file with the headline, summary, and link to the full article.

To-Do
------
* Scrape more than just the one site for articles.
* Work on the over all display of the html file, it's not overly well formatted currently.
* Test on Linux, I know it will have trouble when trying to run the os.startfile() line.

Usage
------
Download the files, go to terminal and simply run:
```
python geeksScrape.py
```
